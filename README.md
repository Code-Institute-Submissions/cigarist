Cigarist is a cigar post and review site. Users can create their own post with reviews, read their own or other user posts, update their own posts and reviews and delete their own posts.
As a cigar enthusiast myself I often wonder if other people get the same flavours and aromas as I do or if they can get a completely different profile. This app was created to track what cigars I have tried and also to see other users reviews on cigars I may want to try in the future. On top of all that it allows me to test my theory on flavour profiles against other users flavour profiles. The website can be seen [here](https://cigarist.herokuapp.com/).

### Structure Plane
The website is designed to look simple and inviting. A user can get anywhere within one click. On an initial load to the page a user is immediately on the 'All Posts' page where they can see all other users posts. Should they choose to register it is as simple as looking to the top right side of the nav bar to register. If they are a registered user it is just as simple to login. Even if a new user accidentally clicks to the login page they can still navigate quickly to the registration page by scrolling to the bottom of the page. This is also true for existing users to login.

Once a user is logged in they will be directed straight to their own profile page where if they have already made posts will be able to see all their own posts. Also with the ability to edit or delete straight from the 'Profile' page.

While logged in user can easily browse through pages and can create, update and delete their own posts.

Finally a user can easily log out of their account by clicking on 'log out'.
