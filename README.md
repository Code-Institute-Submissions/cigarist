Cigarist is a cigar post and review site. Users can create their own post with reviews, read their own or other user posts, update their own posts and reviews and delete their own posts.
As a cigar enthusiast myself I often wonder if other people get the same flavours and aromas as I do or if they can get a completely different profile. This app was created to track what cigars I have tried and also to see other users reviews on cigars I may want to try in the future. On top of all that it allows me to test my theory on flavour profiles against other users flavour profiles. The website can be seen [here](https://cigarist.herokuapp.com/).

## UX

To develop this website we have broken down the UX into its five planes to define the clientâ€™s needs.

### Strategy Plane
| Client Goals:                                         | User Stories:                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Structure Plane
The website is designed to look simple and inviting. A user can get anywhere within one click. On an initial load to the page a user is immediately on the 'All Posts' page where they can see all other users posts. Should they choose to register it is as simple as looking to the top right side of the nav bar to register. If they are a registered user it is just as simple to login. Even if a new user accidentally clicks to the login page they can still navigate quickly to the registration page by scrolling to the bottom of the page. This is also true for existing users to login.

Once a user is logged in they will be directed straight to their own profile page where if they have already made posts will be able to see all their own posts. Also with the ability to edit or delete straight from the 'Profile' page.

While logged in user can easily browse through pages and can create, update and delete their own posts.

Finally a user can easily log out of their account by clicking on 'log out'.

### Skeleton Plane
The project wireframes were created with Balsamiq. We have created 3 versions of the website on different viewing 
platforms. Desktop, mobile and tablet view to show the client how the website will render on different devices.

- [Desktop](https://github.com/jtwy23/cigarist/blob/master/mockups/desktop.pdf)

- [Mobile](https://github.com/jtwy23/cigarist/blob/master/mockups/mobile.pdf)

- [Tablet](https://github.com/jtwy23/cigarist/blob/master/mockups/tablet.pdf)

### Surface Plane
To gain a simple and easy to read website the following design choices have been made.

- The font choice is 'Roboto'. For ease of reading to the user.

- White (#ffffff) text was used in the navbar titles to contrast with the orange (#ff9800) background.

- All H2 headings are also orange (#ff9800) to make the heading more impactful for the user.

- Black (#000000de) text was chosen for all the post text to keep easy on the eyes for the user against the white 
background.

- With the buttons 'Reset' and 'Delete' the color choice was a bright red (#f44336). Something simple to alert 
the user that when pressed it may have consequences. As with the 'Search' and 'Edit' buttons I have kept it to 
the orange (#ff9800) to keep in line with the sites color scheme.

- The modal box footer buttons have a similar color scheme. The 'Delete' button is still red (#f44336) but I have 
switched the 'Cancel' button to orange (#ff9800) to helps users relate to the sites color scheme.

## Features

-	The navigation is fixed to not distract the user from scrolling through posts. 
-	The images displayed on the 'Register' and 'Login' page is to allows users to know they are on a cigar related 
site.
-	There is a user registration form that new users can use to quickly sign up and start posting. It will also 
tell a new user if the username is already taken.
-	There is a  login and logout function. The login function is a form that checks who is trying to login and load 
up the users profile. The logout function is a click away and the user is safely logged out.
-	Logged in users have full search functionality on the 'All Posts' page should they want to search for the brand 
of cigar, vitola of the cigar or simply whether the cigar is hand made or not.
-	A javascript modal box was implemented to the 'Delete' button as defensive progamming. This will add an extra 
barrier for th euser when deleting posts or rather prevent them for deleting the wrong post.
-	The full project was built with a responsive design in mind. With this the user can view the site across all 
devices and screen sizes.

### Future Features
-	A feature that will be implemented in the future is for users to comment on their own or other users posts.
-	A button for users to like or favourite any posts they see and like.
-   The ability to be able to upload an image from any device that stores users images locally to the site. Rather 
than using the url of images a user can find online.
