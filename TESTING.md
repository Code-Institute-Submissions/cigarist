#### Navbar / Mobile Side Nav
The navbar and mobile side nav was tested. All links are clickable and land on to the correct pages. The Title 
is also clickable and returns the user back to the intended page. When on smaller screen sizes the bars icon appears
and when pressed loads the mobile side nav.

#### add_post.html

#### cigar_posts.html
This page is the main page a user lands on when logged in or as a new user. The user posts loads up as expected and 
is neatly stacked one on top of another on all screen sizes. The user that is logged in can see the 'Edit' and 
'Delete' buttons on their own posts, but other user posts do not display the buttons. The search bar works well. On 
testing it searches for all the categories I have set which are cigar brand name, vitola and wheter or not the 
cigar is hand made. These were the only search categories added because I felt that a user will be more likely to 
search on those key terms.

#### edit_posts.html

#### login.html

#### profile.html

#### register.html

#### Social Media Icons
The three social media icons were tested by clicking on each icon. When pressed a new page is opened up and takes
the user to the intended social media platform.
